            I have been a member of chess.com for 8 years, and in that time have
            also tried other online chess websites but did not find them to be
            as comprehensive or well-managed as this one.

            When I started playing chess I was very bad. Then one summer morning
            I decided to create an account on CHESS I would play people then, if
            they played an opening that I liked I would learn it (by using CHESS
            's databases) and improve.
